Approach 1:Previous approaches to drowsiness detection primarily make pre-assumptions about the relevant behavior, focusing on blink rate, eye closure, and yawning.  

Approach 2: Here we employ machine learning to datamine actual human behavior during drowsiness episodes.

According to Andreassi (2000), a relaxed person blinks about 15-20 times per
minute, although only 2-4 are needed from a physiological viewpoint. When performing
cognitive tasks the blink frequency drops to as little as 3 blinks per minute, whereas an
increase in blink frequency indicates reduced vigilance (Hargutt & Kr√ºger, 2000).
